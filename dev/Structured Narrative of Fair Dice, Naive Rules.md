### Apparatus

#### Die

A die is a cube with each face noted with 1 to 6 dots, like ⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅ 

When a player randomly rolls the die, it can stop landing in certain position, with it's upward face considered the scoring face for the roll. 

We say that a die is *fair* when each of it's 6 faces is equally probable to end up as a scoring face. So probability for each is: $$P_X = \frac 1 6$$

Otherwise, if a die is manipulated to probably scoring some faces more often than the others, we can say the die is *loaded* or *weighted*, or more specifically - *biased towards certain outcome*.

### Gameplay

Rolling 
- Player stakes his money.
- Player rolls (shakes and throws) a couple of fair dice.
- Dice roll and stop in a specific combination
- Rolling is complete when both dice stop in their final positions, revealing the scoring faces.

Winning and Losing
- Player wins if both die stop in same face, i.e. ⚀⚀ or ⚁⚁ and so on and gets payed according to score table. 
- Otherwise player loses his stake to casino.
